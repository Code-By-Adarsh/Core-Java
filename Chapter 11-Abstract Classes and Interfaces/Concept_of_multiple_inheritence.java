        Note : 1) Interfaces in Java is a bit like the Class
        but with significant difference.
        2)An interfaces only have method signatures,fields and default methods.
         3)The class implementing interfaces needs to declare the methods (not fields).
         4)You can create a reference of an interfaces but not the objects.
         5)Interfaces methods are public by default.
